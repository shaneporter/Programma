Programma is the typeface I use when programming and teaching about
programming. Programma is a sans serif monospace typeface. Programma comes
in two weights: Regular and Bold.

Programma is eclectic. It borrows ideas from Microgramma, Courier, Palatino,
Twentieth Century, and others. Programma is not suitable for most purposes,
but it is pretty good at representing computer programs.

Programma is still being tinkered with, but it is mostly done.

Programma is in the Public Domain. You are free to use it. But if you ask
if I will give you a license, the answer will be "absolutely not".
